# Downstream Specifications — Index

Source authority: `architecture/SPEC.md` §29 (master) and `architecture/SPEC-AI.md` §35 (AI).

All entries below are **Not started** — files in this repo are placeholders. Each downstream specification is owned per the matrix below and must conform to the upstream Class 2 architecture.

## Conventions

- A downstream specification cannot supersede or contradict its Class 2 parent. Conflicts escalate to ARB.
- Each Class 3 spec must declare the ADRs it depends on; no spec ships without those ADRs in **Accepted** state.
- Each Class 4 runbook must declare its named on-call rotation and PIR template before being marked production-ready.
