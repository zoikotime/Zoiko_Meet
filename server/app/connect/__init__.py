"""Zoiko Connect v3 bounded-context services.

This package is intentionally isolated from the legacy `app.api` and
`app.websocket` trees. Legacy code stays running for backwards compatibility
during the strangler-fig migration; new features land here.

Mounting: `app.main` imports `connect.router` and mounts it at `/api/connect`.
